# Biography

I am an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the College of William and Mary. I received a Ph.D. in sociology at Boston University. My research investigates how institutionalized social inequalities shape patterns of health outcomes and health disparities, particularly for racial and ethnic minority groups.

Some of my previous research has drawn on cross-national comparison and multi-level statistical analysis to ask why relative health inequalities are larger or smaller in some countries compared to others, and how the state, civil society, and other institutions shape patterns of health disparities across contexts.

Broadly, I teach and research topics related to racial and ethnic stratification, international migration (particularly from countries in the Middle East), research methods, and the social determinants of health and illness.
