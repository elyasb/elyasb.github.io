Although socioeconomic status often contributes to a portion of ethno-racial health disparities, there are many unanswered questions about the relationship between socioeconomic status and ethno-racial health disparities across contexts. Recent scholarship in the USA has found support for a ``diminished returns'' effect in which the socioeconomic health gradient is systematically smaller for marginalized groups, yet it is unclear whether this pattern exists in other national contexts. This study tests the interaction between socioeconomic status and ethno-racial minority status in 30 countries across six waves of the European Social Survey. The results include evidence of the diminished returns pattern, particularly for populations with origins in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. Multilevel mixed-effects models find variation across countries in the interaction between socioeconomic status and ethno-racial minority status. The findings suggest racism and socioeconomic status interact to affect health and health disparities in multiple contexts and highlight the importance of cross-national comparison to further understand variation across countries.","tags":["Ethnic minorities","Europe","Health","Health disparities","Socioeconomic status"],"title":"Diminished Returns in Europe: Socioeconomic Status and Ethno-Racial Health Disparities Across 30 Countries in the European Social Survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elyas Bakhtiari"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1659312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659312000,"objectID":"d8007f9dcba746ac997c5414ee451e4d","permalink":"https://elyasb.github.io/publication/bakhtiari-2022/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T19:55:38.570696Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bakhtiari-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Immigrant populations typically have lower mortality rates and longer life expectancies than their nonimmigrant counterparts. This immigrant mortality advantage has been a recurrent finding in demographic and population health research focused on contemporary waves of immigration. However, historical data suggest that European immigrants to the United States in the early twentieth century had worse health and higher rates of mortality, yet it remains unclear why a mortality advantage was absent for immigrants during this period. This article combines Vital Statistics records and Lee–Carter mortality models to analyze mortality by nativity status for the U.S. White population from 1900 to 1960, examining variation by age, sex, time, and place. Contrary to contemporary expectations of a foreign-born mortality advantage, White immigrants had higher mortality rates in the early 1900s, with the largest foreign-born disadvantage among the youngest and oldest populations. Although foreign-born and U.S.-born White mortality rates trended toward convergence over time, the foreign-born mortality penalty remained into the 1950s. A decomposition analysis finds that immigrants' concentration in cities, which had higher rates of infectious disease mortality, accounted for nearly half of the nativity difference in 1900, and this place effect declined in subsequent decades. Additional evidence, such as a spike in mortality inequalities during the 1918 influenza pandemic, suggests that common explanations for the immigrant mortality advantage may be less influential in a context of high risk from infectious disease.","tags":[],"title":"The Missing Mortality Advantage for European Immigrants to the United States in the Early Twentieth Century","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elyas Bakhtiari"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"acfadebce3e3fc31aa4facc2ef23cbe5","permalink":"https://elyasb.github.io/publication/bakhtiari-2022-a/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T19:55:38.578726Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bakhtiari-2022-a/","section":"publication","summary":"European immigrants to the United States in the early twentieth century occupied a ``middle tier'' in the ethnoracial hierarchy. The author uses mortality data disaggregated by nativity (1900–1960) and parental nativity (1900–1920) to examine intraracial and interracial mortality inequalities during this period. The findings suggest that variation within the white population mirrored the ethnoracial hierarchy: the U.S.-born white population with U.S.-born parents had the lowest rates of mortality from 1900 to 1920, and the foreign-born white population had higher rates than their U.S.-born counterparts. Given this heterogeneity, interracial inequality is higher when various U.S.-born white populations are the reference. Disaggregation also reveals divergent trends, such as the exceptionally high foreign-born mortality rates during the 1918 influenza pandemic. The findings suggest that analyses of mortality inequalities that rely on white population averages may understate intra- and interracial inequalities in relation to the ethnoracial hierarchy of the era.","tags":["historical demography","immigration","mortality","racial disparities"],"title":"European Immigration and Patterns of Intra- and Interracial Mortality Inequality in the United States, 1900 to 1960","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elyas Bakhtiari","Deenesh Sohoni"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"d0bcbe8ff3eaa3ec47997bc754bd3862","permalink":"https://elyasb.github.io/publication/bakhtiari-2021-b/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T19:55:38.563155Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bakhtiari-2021-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Intermarriage is an important indicator of immigrant integration trajectories and the rigidity of ethnoracial boundaries. Although questions of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) integration and social exclusion occupy a central place in public discourse, little is known about their marriage patterns. The authors use the 2017 American Community Survey to estimate patterns of coethnic, panethnic, and intergroup marriages for MENA populations. Compared with other immigrant groups, rates of intermarriage are relatively high, and there is little evidence of ``panethnic'' patterns of marriage. However, more recent marriages have become less exogamous. Hierarchical age-period-cohort models suggest that this is driven by changing patterns among more recent cohorts, with some evidence of a post-2001 period effect among men. Compositional changes in the country of origin account for some, but not all, of these cohort effects. The findings highlight the importance of further research on MENA Americans to understand their unique social experiences of the U.S. ethnoracial hierarchy, particularly in the context of increasing racialized anti-Arab and anti-Muslim discrimination after 2001.","tags":[],"title":"Changing Boundaries of Whiteness?

Discrimination often does not align with categorical comparisons but is racialized in practice. This study explicitly tests the effects of such racialized discrimination by using the increase in anti-Muslim discrimination following the attacks of September 11, 2001 as a natural experiment. Sociological scholarship suggests anti-Muslim discrimination has been racialized in a way that affects a variety of Middle Eastern and South Asian populations who are often targeted based on physical appearance, rather than religious identification. Using a name-matching algorithm to classify mothers based on name characteristics, I examine birth outcomes for mothers with ancestry from the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and a subset of South Asian Sikhs. I find that rates of low birth weight births increased for both Middle Eastern and North African (1.15 RR, 95% CI: 1.00- 1.31) and South Asian Sikh (1.61 RR, 95% CI: 1.06-2.40) mothers in the 37 weeks following September 11, relative to the same period one year prior. The results highlight how processes of racialization can distribute discrimination-linked stress as a risk factor in ways that are overlooked when relying on institutionalized racial, ethnic, or religious categories to study disparities.,                                        •               Scholarship suggests Muslim racialization affects a variety of populations based on physical appearance, rather than religious identification.                                         •               This study tests the effects of racialized discrimination using anti-Muslim discrimination after 9/11 as a natural experiment.                                         •               This study uses name characteristics to identify Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Sikh mothers in California.                                         •               LBW births increased for MENA and Sikh mothers following September 11, but not the broader population of South Asian mothers.                                         •               Racialization distributes discrimination and stress in ways overlooked by single categories of race, ethnicity, or religion.","tags":[],"title":"Health Effects of Muslim Racialization: Evidence from Birth Outcomes in California before and after September 11, 2001","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Hugo Blox Builder is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

We compare minority health inequalities across 22 European countries (N = 199,981) to investigate how two such arrangements—welfare state effort and immigrant incorporation policies—influence the distribution of health and health inequalities. We examine two measures of health from seven waves of the European Social Survey. Results from a series of multilevel mixed-effects models show that minority health inequalities vary across contexts and persist after accounting for socioeconomic differences. Cross-level interaction results show that welfare state effort is associated with better health for all groups but is unrelated to levels of inequality between groups. In contrast, policies aimed at protecting minorities from discrimination correlate with smaller relative health inequalities.","tags":[],"title":"Institutions, Incorporation, and Inequality: The Case of Minority Health Inequalities in Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Previous research suggests that integration into U.S. society can be detrimental to the health and mortality outcomes of many minority immigrant groups. Popular explanations for post-migration health changes have focused on individual-level mechanisms, such as behavioral changes associated with acculturation. I use multiple sources of data and a variety of quantitative methods to situate these changes in a context of racial inequality for three migrant groups. In my first case, I draw on historical data collected from the Vital Statistics of the United States and the U.S. Census to analyze the changing health trajectories associated with European immigrants' transition from marginalized minorities to members of the white majority in the early 20th century. My second case draws on restricted-use data from the National Survey of American Life to test how interpersonal and institutionalized racial discrimination influence health patterns of black immigrants from the Caribbean. In my third case, I use population-level birth data from New York City (2000-2010) to investigate changes in birth outcomes associated with elevated anti-Muslim sentiment after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Taken together, these cases demonstrate how racial formation in the United States shapes patterns of post-migration outcomes. I find that marginalized European immigrants exhibited patterns of worsening mortality trajectories, but the overall gap between European immigrants and native-born whites narrowed as racial categories were redefined in the early 20th century. This pattern of intergenerational health improvement contrasts with the segmented trajectories of contemporary Caribbean black immigrants, whose health is shaped by experiences of both interpersonal and institutionalized racism. Similarly, rates of low birth weight births increased for Middle Eastern and Asian Indian immigrants in the decade after the attacks of September 11, 2001, likely due to increased experiences of discrimination. By tying health trajectories and outcome disparities to the construction and stratification of racial boundaries, I advance theory about the \\\"upstream\\\" social causes of health and illness and develop a framework for analyzing the sociohistorical formation of health disparities.","tags":["health disparities","Immigration","Medical sociology","race","Social sciences"],"title":"Unhealthy Trajectories: Race, Migration, and the Formation of Health Disparities in the United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sigrun Olafsdottir","Elyas Bakhtiari"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d476622db2dd8a8893d8680ba1140b1d","permalink":"https://elyasb.github.io/publication/olafsdottir-2015/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T19:55:38.612405Z","relpermalink":"/publication/olafsdottir-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Healthcare policy is one of contemporary society's most dynamic policy arenas. Heightened pressures for action and reform, such as the global economic crisis, demographic changes, and inequity, have increased interest in international, transnational, and global health policy and this, in turn, has fuelled comparative research. Yet, new concepts of healthcare may create diverse and contradictory results in different parts of the world that call for careful empirical investigation and for a systematic approach that brings the complexity of governing healthcare into perspective.Starting with more general issues of healthcare policy and governance in a global perspective and using the lens of national case studies of healthcare reform, this international handbook addresses key themes in the debates over changing healthcare policy. This includes future health human resources needs and planning, major concepts of management and leadership in healthcare, traditional and new emergent areas of new governance, and the challenges of equity and equality in the development, provision of and access to healthcare services for diverse groups of citizens. With a focus on connections, including interactions between healthcare policy and governance, international comparison and global policy, global and local perspectives, and macro- and micro-level policy using a multi-level governance approach, this handbook provides nuanced research that illuminates the intricate issues in healthcare policy and governance across the globe.","tags":[],"title":"Citizenship and Healthcare Policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sigrun Olafsdottir","Elyas Bakhtiari","Emily Barman"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"4887457293188889d5a4f99c6ecaa47b","permalink":"https://elyasb.github.io/publication/olafsdottir-2014/","publishdate":"2023-11-23T19:55:38.6054Z","relpermalink":"/publication/olafsdottir-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Social scientists have long recognized that macro-level factors have the potential to shape the health of populations and individuals. Along these lines, they have theorized about the role of the welfare state in creating more equal opportunities and outcomes and how this intervention may benefit health. More recently, scholars and policymakers alike have pointed out how the involvement of civil society actors may replace or complement any state effort. Using data from the World Values Surveys and the European Values Study, combined with national-level indicators for welfare state and civil society involvement, we test the impact of each sector on health and health inequalities in 25 countries around the world. We find that both have a statistically significant effect on overall health, but the civil society sector may have a greater independent influence in societies with weaker welfare states. The health inequalities results are less conclusive, but suggest a strong civil society may be particularly beneficial to vulnerable populations, such as the low income and unemployed. Our paper represents an early step in providing empirical evidence for the impact of the welfare state and civil society on health and health inequalities.","tags":["Civil society","Cross-national research","health inequalities","Welfare state"],"title":"Public or Private?

One strand of research focuses on inequalities in health within a single country. A separate and newer strand of research focuses on the relationship between inequality and average population health across countries. Despite the theorization of (presumably variable) social conditions as ``fundamental causes'' of disease and health, the cross-national literature has focused on average, aggregate population health as the central outcome. Controversies currently surround macro-structural determinants of overall population health, such as income inequality. We advance and redirect these debates by conceptualizing inequalities in health as cross-national variables that are sensitive to social conditions. Using data from 48 World Values Survey countries, representing 74% of the world's population, we examine cross-national variation in inequalities in health. The results reveal substantial variation in health inequalities according to income, education, sex, and migrant status. While higher socioeconomic position is associated with better self-rated health around the globe, the size of the association varies across institutional context and across dimensions of stratification. There is some evidence that education and income are more strongly associated with self-rated health than sex or migrant status.","tags":["global","Health","inequality"],"title":"Health Inequalities in Global Context","type":"publication"}]
